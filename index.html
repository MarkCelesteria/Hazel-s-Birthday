      Happy 40<sup>th</sup> Birthday, Hazel Sumile! ðŸŽ‰...<br><br>
      Here's to celebrating the wonderful person you've become over these 40 years, <br>
      and to many more years of happiness, health, and success. Enjoy your day! <br><br>
      My name is Rey Mark Degamo, and I have the pleasure of being your daughter classmates. <br>
      I sincerely hope that you have taken a moment to make a special wish on this joyous occasion of your birthday. It is my belief that such rituals add a touch of magic to our lives. <br>
      I had initially planned to join the celebration of your birthday. However, I regret to inform you that I am currently unable to attend as I am presently enjoying my vacation in Cebu. <br><br>
      Moving on to the one of the main purpose of this message... <br><br>
      I have had the pleasure of getting to know your daughter over the past few months, and I am writing to express my sincere interest in wanting to know her better. She is a remarkable person, and I am continually impressed by her kindness, intelligence, and the respect she shows to everyone around her. <br>
      I believe in the importance of respect and transparency, so I felt it was necessary to seek your permission before proceeding further. I understand that as a parent, you would want the best for your daughter, and I want to assure you that my intentions are genuine and honorable. <br>
      I promise to respect and honor your daughter's boundaries and to contribute positively to her life. I also understand the importance of open communication and would be more than willing to discuss any concerns or questions you might have. <br>
      Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. <br>
      Once Again Happy Birthday!!!
